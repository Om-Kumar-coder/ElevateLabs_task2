### 1. **What is phishing?**  
Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (e.g., banks, companies) via email, messages, or websites to trick victims into revealing sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers) or downloading malware.  

### 2. **How to identify a phishing email?**  
- **Generic greetings** (e.g., "Dear User" instead of your name).  
- **Urgent or threatening language** (e.g., "Your account will be suspended!").  
- **Suspicious links** (hover to check the URL; look for misspellings like "paypa1.com").  
- **Unusual sender addresses** (e.g., "support@amaz0n.net").  
- **Requests for sensitive data** (e.g., passwords, SSN).  
- **Poor grammar/spelling**.  

### 3. **What is email spoofing?**  
Email spoofing is when attackers forge the "From" address to make an email appear to come from a trusted source (e.g., your boss or a well-known company), even though it’s fake.  

### 4. **Why are phishing emails dangerous?**  
- **Identity theft**: Stolen personal/financial data.  
- **Malware infections**: Ransomware, spyware, etc.  
- **Financial loss**: Unauthorized transactions.  
- **Account takeover**: Hackers gain access to emails, social media, or banking.  

### 5. **How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?**  
- **Check email headers**: Look for mismatched "Return-Path" or domains.  
- **Contact the sender directly**: Use a known phone number or official website (not the email’s contact info).  
- **Use email authentication tools**: Check for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records (visible in headers).  

### 6. **What tools can analyze email headers?**  
- **MXToolbox** (mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)  
- **Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader** (toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/)  
- **Email header analyzers** (e.g., **Header Analyzer** by **GitHub** tools).  

### 7. **What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?**  
- **Do not click links or download attachments**.  
- **Report it**: Use your email provider’s "Report Phishing" option (e.g., Gmail’s "Report spam").  
- **Delete the email** after reporting.  
- **Scan your device** for malware if you interacted with the email.  
- **Notify your IT team** (if at work).  

### 8. **How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?**  
They exploit human psychology by:  
- **Creating urgency** ("Your account is compromised! Click now!").  
- **Impersonating authority** (e.g., pretending to be IT support or a CEO).  
- **Offering fake rewards** ("You won a prize!").  
- **Leveraging fear** (e.g., fake legal threats or fines).  

### **Bonus Tip**: Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** on accounts to reduce phishing risks.
