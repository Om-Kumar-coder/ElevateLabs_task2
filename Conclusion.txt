Step-by-Step Analysis

1. Obtain a sample phishing email
✅ We created the above fake example for training purposes.


---

2. Examine sender's email address for spoofing

Legit PayPal emails come from something like:
service@paypal.com or support@paypal.com

This one comes from:
support@secure-paypal-alert.com → suspicious look-alike domain.



---

3. Check email headers for discrepancies

Using an email header analyzer would reveal:

Originating IP not related to PayPal servers.

SPF/DKIM authentication failures.

“Reply-To” address different from “From” address.




---

4. Identify suspicious links or attachments

Link text: https://paypal.com.verify-secure-login-update-account.com

Real domain: verify-secure-login-update-account.com

Not PayPal.


No attachments in this example, but many phishing mails use .zip or .docm files.



---

5. Look for urgent or threatening language

Phrases like:

“Urgent”

“Verify within 12 hours”

“Permanent suspension”
These are psychological pressure tactics.




---

6. Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link)

Link appears to say PayPal, but hover shows a different domain.

Legit companies rarely use redirecting or multi-part domains like this.



---

7. Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors

This one has no big spelling mistakes but slightly awkward phrasing:

“Please verify your account within 12 hours” sounds robotic.

Official emails usually use your real name.




---

8. Summarize phishing traits found

Look-alike domain in sender’s address.

Suspicious URL that isn’t PayPal.

Urgency & threat to scare the user.

Generic greeting (“Dear Customer”).

Header discrepancies if checked.

Possible malicious links.
